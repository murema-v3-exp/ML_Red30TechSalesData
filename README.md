Learning and Practicing Machine learning through using classification and clustering algorithms on the Red30 Tech Sales Dataset

Machine Learning Strives to understand the relationship betweeen input and output variables using programming and mathematics.
It uses computer algorithms to study data, learn patterns and provide predictive results.

There are two types of machine learning algorithms: Supervised and Unsupervised

1. Supervised Machine Learning
   - Data contains inputs and also outputs
   - It uses outputs for reference when training
   - Often used for classification of data into groups
   - Uses training and testing data to classify payment status
   - Algorithms include: Logistic Regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks

a) Decision Trees
- A flowchart like model used for classification and regression
- Splits data into branches based on feature values, making decisions at each node until the final outcome at the leaf node
  
b) Random Forests
- Combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting
- Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features
- Final prediction is made by either averaging (regression) or majority voting (classification)
  
c) Support Vector Machines 
- Uses classification margin as a separator for where it places values
- Can be used for classification or regresssion 
- Chooses separator with the largest margin between values classified into the different categories
- Samples determining the best margin for the ultimate separating hyperplane are called support vectors, hence the name.
